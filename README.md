sketch-archive
web site as an archive of personal drawings and sketchbooks

This web site will be a place to show all my drawings, since I started to colect sketchbooks.
Will have a main page talking about the what is like to have a book that you can draw any time, and how good it is to keep drawing as a graphic diary.

It is a simple website, I'm still learning how to code and getting to know what can I do to improve the page.
